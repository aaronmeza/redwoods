      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        The Redwoods was founded to bring the warmth of Sonoma & Napa’s forested hillsides to a
        cozy 750‑sq‑ft tasting room. Our live‑edge bar and moss accents honor the towering groves,
        while our flights showcase small‑lot wines crafted within miles of those ancient trunks.
      </p>
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We believe wine should evoke place. Every material—from reclaimed redwood to forest‑green
        seating—mirrors the terroir in your glass.
