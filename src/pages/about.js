      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        I grew up under the California sun, splitting weekends between the winding roads of Sonoma
        Valley and the hushed cathedrals of the redwood forest. Those childhood trips etched two
        sensations into my memory: the exhilaration of tasting a wine you’ve never heard of and the
        grounding calm of standing beneath a 300-foot giant at
        <strong> Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve</strong>.
        <strong> The Redwoods</strong> is my attempt to carry
        that dual wonder—curiosity and tranquility—1,900&nbsp;miles east to Northfield, Minnesota.

        The lounge is intentionally intimate—just 750 sq ft—because the best conversations happen
        elbow-to-elbow at a live-edge bar. Redwood paneling and preserved moss honor those towering
        groves, while the flight list stays proudly Californian: small-lot Pinot from Russian River,
        sun-kissed Zin from Dry Creek, and a rotating “road-trip” slot that changes with the seasons.
        Each pour is a postcard home.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We believe wine should <em>evoke place</em>. Every material—from reclaimed redwood to
        forest-green leather—mirrors the terroir in your glass. By keeping production runs tiny and
        conversations long, we trade mass-market polish for authentic connection. Ask questions,
        compare notes, and—above all—stay curious.
      </p>

      <h2>The Flight Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Think of our flights as guided hikes through flavor: three or four 3-oz pours arranged from
        bright to brooding, each with a story card so you can taste with intention. Pair them with
        local cheeses or house-marinated olives, breathe in the cedar-and-sage aroma drifting from
        the bar, then dive back in. It’s a small ritual that turns drinking into discovery.

        Whether you’re a lifelong oenophile or someone who just learned how to pronounce
        “Cabernet,” we built this place for you. Welcome to the grove—let’s explore together.
